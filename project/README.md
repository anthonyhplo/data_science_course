# Capstone project

The capstone project is a requirement of grduation. Just like any other projects you will be doing as a Data Scientist, you will need to have your

- Presentation slides
- Python code with comment (.py or .ipynb)
- Dataset (raw data and processed data)
- Data dictionary

**We will select the top projects for video shooting** 


## Week 15: Create Ideas

- Dataset: What data will you use for this project? What information can this dataset provide to you?
  - Kaggle
  - Scraping
  - Other sources


## Week 16: Data Processing, Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis

- What data have you gathered, and how did you gather it?
- Which areas of the data have you cleaned, and which areas still need cleaning?
- What steps have you taken to explore the data?
- What insights have you gained from your exploration?
- Will you be able to answer your question with this data, or do you need to gather more data (or adjust your question)?
- How might you use modeling to answer your question?
